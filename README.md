# About this repository
This repository includes a jupyter notebook that allows you to convert your (n x 1) data into (m x m) matrix data and to visualize the data as a 2D-map. Things you have to prepare and specify are as follows:
- (n x 1) numerical data (.txt or .dat format). Here, the integer n should be n = m^2, where m is also the integer.
- Location of your data.
- Upper and lower limits for x and y axes.
- Type of a color map.  
  
# Motivation
Sometimes, two-dimensional data (m x m matrix) are stored as one-dimentional data (m^2 x 1 vector). The unrolled data might be processed using some methods. After processing your data, you would like to check the results by visualizing your processed data. This program can help you check the data. 

# Quick test
Since a sample data file named "sample.dat" is also included in this repository, you can test this program at first to see how it works.
