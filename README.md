# 2D-map
This jupyter notebook allows you to convert your (n x 1) data into (m x m) matrix data and to visualize the data as a 2D-map. Things you have to prepare and specify are as follows
- (n x 1) numerical data (.txt or .dat format). Here, the integer n should be n = m^2, where m is also the integer.
- Location of your data.
- Upper and lower limits for x and y axes.
- Type of a color map.
